This program will allow you to draw in a defined window a journey. You just have to get yours XML files wich indicate your jouney.
I used the app "GPSLogger" to save my positions and others info ; so I make this program depending on banneers that I found in my 
XML files. Maybe if you use an other app it won't works, I didn't try with others.
It should give you an idea at least on what you have to do.
I make a separate program to find all min/max ; for now, I haven't yet finish this program, so you will see updates in weeks 
coming.


So, to use it :
First step, you have to load all yours XML files in minmax program to find min max.
Then copy them into MAP_XML and don't forget to also load your XML. Then if you run the program it should works.
I put an picture of what is my result for now, not exciting, but in progress.

Enjoy
